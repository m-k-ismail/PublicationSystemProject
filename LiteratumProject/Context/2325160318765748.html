<h1>A Year of Opportunities</h1>
<span>Donna Ryan, RN, RD, MPH, CDE, FAADE</span>
<p>Someone recently asked me what I am most excited about for diabetes educators in 2018. In a word, opportunities. Make that 2 words: incredible opportunities! By that, I mean I am excited to see how AADE and our members embrace and act on the many great opportunities we have this year.</p>
<p>This is the third year of our very aggressive and visionary 2016-2018 strategic plan. We carefully positioned AADE and our members with the resources, tools, and initiatives that provide professional growth, critical partnerships, necessary collaborations, and success in a rapidly changing health care world. Our strategic initiatives focus on empowering diabetes educators, expanding our influence and success in current and new models of care, and embracing the future, all with the support of technology, a focus on quality, and keeping the person with diabetes at the center.</p>
<p>Some of the exciting opportunities we have in 2018 include technology and the digital revolution. Earlier this year, we rolled out the DANA App Review (DANAapps.org). This curated library of health and wellness mobile app reviews is available only to AADE members as part of our new DANA (Diabetes Advanced Network Access) online technology initiative. This summer, we will launch the full DANA platform that provides a state-of-the-art member resource for all things related to diabetes technology: wearable devices, insulin delivery systems, new products, research, training courses, and more.</p>
<p>In 2018, we continue to proactively engage the peer support communities (PSC) as important partners with diabetes educators to support the person with diabetes. These communities include the online and in-person support systems that reinforce positive messages for self-management of diabetes and chronic conditions. Peer support communities are a crucial part of the health care model, and evidence is growing of the positive impact on important diabetes outcomes such as glycemic management. I encourage you to check out our peer support resource hub at DiabetesEducator.org/PeerSupport.</p>
<p>Additional opportunities for 2018 also include identifying the many and expanding business and delivery models for diabetes education, prevention, and support. Strengthening our current programs for optimal reimbursement is always a major focus of AADE. With health care evolution in full swing, we see a movement from fee for service to value-based models, which relies on quality outcomes for financial solvency in addition to reimbursement. It is vitally important that AADE focus on our integration into all models of health care systems. We are collecting real-world evidence of members who are practicing in new models of care, like population health. You can find the new practice group &ldquo;Population Health&rdquo; in AADE&rsquo;s member-only My AADE Network. There will also be many learning opportunities at AADE18 in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Finally, as an enduring chapter in professional growth, AADE has undertaken an in-depth and multifaceted review of where the profession is and where it is headed. AADE&rsquo;s work to create a &ldquo;visioning&rdquo; plan began in 2017 and will be finalized in 2018. Together with an outside marketing firm, we are assessing the best possible course for the future so AADE members are in a position to thrive and expand our expertise and scope in the art and science of future health care delivery. We look forward to sharing the final plan with you at AADE18 in Baltimore.</p>
<p>With all this, and more, it is going to be a very exciting year of accomplishments and opportunities, providing a strong springboard to 2019 and beyond. Each year, AADE seems to get better and better, providing timely resources, important information, skills, and tools to our members. We are probably the only professional membership organization where so many of those who specialize and are certified in the profession are members. That is something I am very proud of and committed to, ensuring present and future AADE members have full access to the many opportunities AADE provides.</p>
<p>AADE and our membership have a deep and proactive commitment to quality diabetes education, management, and support. Everything we do is focused on the best possible outcomes for people with and at risk for diabetes and related chronic conditions. Its more than a job, it is our passion. We have put that passion into an aggressive strategic plan that touches each and every one of us in some form or fashion. I look forward to all the opportunities coming this year and look forward to connecting with you as we move forward in our profession. â– </p>
