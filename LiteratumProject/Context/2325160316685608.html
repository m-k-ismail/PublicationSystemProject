<h1>Multidisciplinary Team Visits Offer Unique Approach in the Bronx</h1>
<span>Diana L. Malkin-Washeim, PhD, RD, CDE, CD-N</span>, <span>Isaac Dapkins, MD</span>, <span>Charnicia E. Huggins, PharmD, MS, AE-C, BCACP</span>
<p>Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus are present in endemic proportions in the South and Central Bronx, New York, and are often complicated by behavioral health disorders. Certified diabetes educators (CDE), licensed clinical social workers (LCSW), and licensed pharmacists (RPh) in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) are resources for providing treatment for people living in these communities.</p>
<p>The 2016 consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) includes specific recommendations to address insulin resistance and lifestyle modification, including:</p>
<p>a plant-based dietary approach</p>
<p>limiting sucrose-containing or high-glycemic index foods</p>
<p>adjusting insulin doses to match carbohydrate intake</p>
<p>getting adequate sleep</p>
<p>increasing activity to 150 minutes per week.<a href="#">1</a>
</p>
<p>Educating individuals with diabetes about these recommendations and ensuring patient understanding requires a team approach, as emphasized in both the AACE&rsquo;s 2015 Clinical Practice Guidelines and the 2016 American Diabetes Association&rsquo;s Standards of Medical Care report.<a href="#">2</a>,<a href="#">3</a> Such an approach allows patients to benefit from the expertise of multiple health care providers who may each focus on different aspects of treatment, thus providing comprehensive patient care when working as part of a team. Physicians, nurses, registered dietitians, and mental health professionals are widely accepted as potential team members; however, pharmacists are increasingly becoming recognized as essential members of the diabetes care management team as well.<a href="#">3</a>
</p>
<p>In this brief report, we describe our unique approach to diabetes care, which involves patients attending same-day, one-on-one visits with a team of health care professionals&mdash;a registered dietitian/certified diabetes educator, clinical social worker, and a clinical pharmacist. We have drawn on previously described care models in our approach to improving health outcomes for our patients who have diabetes, are challenged with limited financial resources, and have low food security.<a href="#">4</a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>-<a href="#">8</a>

<h3>It Takes a Team</h3>
<p>Physical health is influenced by a multitude of factors, such as medications, psycho-social behavior, physical activity, and food intake. Pharmacists are trained to improve health outcomes by providing education about medications and the conditions for which they are prescribed, reviewing laboratory results, emphasizing adherence to medication, and promoting lifestyle changes and immunizations.<a href="#">9</a>
</p>
<p>Psychological wellness plays a significant role in physical health as well, and much research points to the prevalence of depression among individuals with diabetes.<a href="#">10</a> Evidence supports the inclusion of a LCSW in team-based care as an intervention strategy to improve health outcomes in patients with chronic medical conditions, specifically among those with depression and diabetes.<a href="#">11</a>
</p>
<p>The LCSWs address mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and personality disorders. In addition, the LCSW can address other stressors including inadequate income and food insecurity. These social determinants can impact diabetes self-management.<a href="#">12</a> The LCSW also assists with exploring coping strategies to improve diabetes self-management and works with patients to address behaviors that impact their ability to adhere to recommended treatments.</p>
<p>The roles of the registered dietitian (RD) and CDEs have been well documented in the literature.<a href="#">2</a>,<a href="#">3</a>,<a href="#">13</a>,<a href="#">14</a> The RDs and CDEs are trained to assist patients with meal planning and facilitate blood glucose monitoring, help patients identify their diabetes self-management goals, and assess patients&rsquo; progress toward these goals.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Background: Team Approach</h3>
<p>A team approach to address diabetes self-management was piloted at The Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center&rsquo;s (BLHC) Health and Wellness Center, a FQHC, in April 2014 and is still in operation. FQHCs are &ldquo;nonprofit, community-based organizations that provide comprehensive primary care and preventive care to medically underserved areas or populations, regardless of their age, ability to pay, or health insurance status.&rdquo;<a href="#">15</a>
</p>
<p>Our FQHC and ambulatory care facility serves patients from the South and Central Bronx, New York City, a county greatly impacted by diabetes and burdened with obesity, food insecurity, and limited housing. The Bronx county has a total population of 1.4 million people (see <a href="#">Table 1</a>).</p>Table 1.<p>2015 Demographics of the Bronx County, New York.<a href="#">21</a>
</p>Population1&thinsp;455&thinsp;444<b>Race and Hispanic origin (%)</b>&emsp;White, alone45.4&emsp;Black or African American alone43.4&emsp;American Indian and Alaska Native, alone2.9&emsp;Asian, alone4.5&emsp;Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, alone0.4&emsp;Two or more races3.4&emsp;Hispanic or Latino55.1&emsp;White, alone, not Hispanic or Latino10.1<b>Housing</b>&emsp;Housing units523&thinsp;690&emsp;Median monthly mortgage$2404&emsp;Median gross rent$1060<b>Language</b>&emsp;Language other than English spoken at home, % of persons age 5+ y57.6<b>Education</b>&emsp;High school graduate or higher, % of persons age 25+ y70.2&emsp;Bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher, % of persons age 25+ y18.3<b>Health Insurance</b>&emsp;Percentage without health insurance, &lt;65 y13.9<b>Income</b>&emsp;Median household income$34&thinsp;284&emsp;Per capita income past 12 months$18&thinsp;269&emsp;Persons in poverty, %31.5<b>Employment</b>&emsp;Total employment246&thinsp;446<p>According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene&rsquo;s 2015 Community Health Profiles report, 31% of adults in the Bronx are obese, and 14% of adults have diabetes.<a href="#">16</a> In the Highbridge and Concourse areas of the Bronx, 29% of adults are obese, and 15% have diabetes. These 2 South and Central Bronx county communities serviced by BLHC have a higher combined prevalence of diabetes (15%) than the 7% reported for Manhattan, New York, 10.6% reported for New York State (NYS), and 12.3% reported for the United States.<a href="#">16</a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>-<a href="#">19</a> In addition, the Bronx has the second highest rate of preventable emergency room visits among all the New York City boroughs and the highest rate of avoidable inpatient admissions, particularly within the Medicaid population of New York state.<a href="#">20</a>
</p>
<p>According to the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness (ICPH), &ldquo;more than one-third (37%) of all family shelter applicants coming from the Bronx and nearly all (92.8%) either black (52.8%) or Hispanic (40%), families in the Bronx are experiencing homelessness at higher rates than families in other NYC boroughs.<a href="#">22</a> Given that 2.8% of all Bronx families and 11.3% of those living in poverty applied for shelter in 2010 and that these households have the highest rates of perceived risk of homelessness, the Bronx&mdash;specifically the South Bronx&mdash;is the epicenter of severe poverty in New York City.&rdquo;<a href="#">22</a> A lack of affordable housing is one of the primary reasons for homelessness among households with children.<a href="#">21</a>
</p>
<p>The ICPH data pooled between 2005 and 2009 showed that the unemployment rate in the South Bronx is 13.9%. This population is burdened by economics, physical and mental issues, and multiple medical diagnoses. It is plausible to theorize that the contributing factors leading to the persistent challenges of food insecurity, housing, and diabetes are interrelated, namely, limited education leads to increased unemployment and decreased annual income that inhibits the purchase of nutrient dense foods, basic household resources, and necessary health care services.</p>
<p>While our team visits are not designed to comprehensively address all of these factors, each practitioner plays a unique role in addressing patients&rsquo; barriers to optimal health. In addition to adjusting insulin regimens, the RD/CDE counsels patients about proper nutrition and distributes health bucks (coupons) for use at local farmer&rsquo;s markets. The RPh reinforces healthy nutrition and exercise recommendations while focusing on the importance of medication adherence to better control diabetes and other chronic conditions. The LCSW helps patients identify and address stress factors that may pose a challenge to their diabetes self-management.</p>

<h3>Structure of Team Visits</h3>
<p>Team visits at our Health and Wellness Center are scheduled twice per month and target patients with either prediabetes or diabetes. Patients are referred to our multidisciplinary team (RPh, RD/CDE, and LCSW) by the Health and Wellness Center&rsquo;s primary care physicians, adult endocrinologists, and team members. The visits not only improve care for our patients but add additional revenue for the facility.</p>
<p>The RD/CDE is a stand-alone provider who bills for each visit. The RPh is not considered a provider under New York State law; however, advances in legislation allow pharmacists in various states, including New York, to bill for medication therapy management services, such as those provided during diabetes team visits.<a href="#">23</a> The LCSW does not currently bill for the visits, but the process to allow for this is currently under development.</p>
<p>During the team visit, patients meet individually with the RPh, the RD/CDE, and the LCSW. The RPh conducts a detailed medication review to ensure patient comprehension of their diabetes and non-diabetes medications, including medication names, doses, and frequency of administration, as well as to ensure that patients are taking their medications as prescribed. The RPh also examines patients&rsquo; medication profile for guideline-directed therapy, including high- or medium-intensity statins for cardiovascular risk reduction and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for blood pressure management when indicated. In addition, the RPh may address patients&rsquo; inability to obtain prescribed medications due to insurance problems or high copayments as well as complaints about too many medications or side effects. The RD/CDE addresses the 7 key behaviors that promote successful diabetes self-management&mdash;healthy eating, being active, blood glucose monitoring, taking medication, problem solving, healthy coping skills, and reducing risks. The LCSW provides mental health counseling to address patients&rsquo; social concerns and coping strategies.</p>
<p>
<p>Each member of the team shares, when needed, specific and significant information that may directly impact the care of a patient.</p>
</p>
<p>Each member of the team shares, when needed, specific and significant information that may directly impact the care of a patient. For example, the LCSW may tell the RPh that a patient is experiencing distress due to the recent loss of a family member, which may decrease the patient&rsquo;s motivation for medication adherence. The RPh may share with the RD/CDE that a patient&rsquo;s elevated A1C may be due to the patient&rsquo;s inability to fill a prescription for an antidiabetic agent or the patient&rsquo;s nonadherence to dietary recommendations. The RD/CDE may share with the RPh patient&rsquo;s concerns about medication-related side effects, such as weight loss or gain, or changes in insulin therapy that should be reinforced during the patient&rsquo;s visit with the RPh.</p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>To illustrate the team approach, we present the case of Luisa (name has been changed), a middle-aged female with a history of type 2 diabetes who presented to the Health and Wellness Center for a diabetes team visit.</p>
<p>Luisa had an elevated A1C and was on combination therapy, including oral and injectable medications. She neglected to bring her medications, blood glucose log book, or glucometer as previously requested.</p>
<p>Luisa first met with the RD/CDE who reviewed her diabetes medications, weighed her, checked her blood glucose, and reviewed her meal plan. The RD/CDE helped Luisa develop strategies to take her rapid-acting insulin pre-meals, continue checking her blood glucose regularly, eat breakfast, and lose 5% of her weight over the following 2 months.</p>
<p>Next, Luisa met with the LCSW who engaged her in a discussion about strategies to decrease her stresses and promote behavior changes to improve her health. Luisa reported that her past and present stressors affected her overall health, hence affecting her blood glucose. The LCSW explored stress reduction techniques and engaged Luisa in deep breathing exercises, which facilitated calmness and relaxation.</p>
<p>Luisa then met with the RPh who measured her blood pressure and reviewed all of her medications. The RPh interviewed Luisa to elicit any medication-related questions or complaints and ensure that she was appropriately taking all of the medications listed in her electronic medical record. The RPh also performed medication reconciliation to ensure that our ambulatory care center&rsquo;s internal records of Luisa&rsquo;s medication regimen matched the medication list provided by her primary care provider (PCP) who was outside our hospital&rsquo;s network of providers.</p>
<p>During the medication review, the RPh recognized a discrepancy with Luisa&rsquo;s medications. It appeared that confusion regarding generic versus brand names caused Luisa to continue taking a medication that had been discontinued by her endocrinologist. Luisa insisted that she was no longer taking the brand medication, Actos (pioglitazone) (Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc, Deerfield, IL), but the generic name for the medication remained on the medication list provided by her PCP. The RPh explained to Luisa that pioglitazone is the generic name for Actos and reemphasized that she should discontinue taking this medication, as per the endocrinologist.</p>
<p>The RPh informed the RD/CDE and the endocrinologist about the misunderstanding and contacted Luisa&rsquo;s PCP to alert him of the endocrinologist&rsquo;s discontinuation of this medication. In addition, the RPh contacted Luisa&rsquo;s pharmacy to discontinue any remaining refills.</p>

<h3>Team Visits: Benefits</h3>
<p>We have found that incorporating the team approach among patients with diabetes and prediabetes not only supplements one-to-one diabetes education but also places equal value on each discipline. It enhances the psychosocial experience while avoiding stigmatization since the psychosocial component is built into the team visit. Team visits also decrease transportation costs for patients who would otherwise have to travel to the ambulatory care clinic on multiple days to meet with each of the 3 specialists included in our team.</p>
<p>Further, the visits allow for repetition of critical health messages that may be relayed verbally by 1 practitioner, such as the RD/CDE, and in written form, by the RPh, who always provides outpatient discharge instructions at the conclusion of the visit. Far from being redundant, we consider this to be beneficial for our patient population who may require constant reinforcement of key messages to reach their health care goals.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Unique and Effective Approach</h3>
<p>We believe that our approach is unique among other hospitals and health care settings in the New York geographic area. No similar team-based delivery care model in New York or the surrounding states that includes all 3 disciplines (RD/CDE, RPh, and LCSW) have been reported in the literature, according to our PubMed search (2000-2015).</p>
<p>As of April 2016, there have been 212 patient participants on 49 team visit days since the initiation of our pilot in April 2014. A brief analysis of the data suggests that our team approach is beneficial to this patient population. A random sample of 32 patients (every fifth participant) revealed that approximately 44% of the sample had a decrease in their A1C from baseline to the second A1C measurement.</p>
<p>The one limitation to our team approach is that visits are conducted twice per month in half-day sessions, and the appointment slots fill up quickly. To avoid the large gap between team visits, separate appointments are scheduled to see the RD/CDE, RPh, and LCSW as needed. We are also in the process of expanding our team visits to another facility within our BLHC system to benefit additional patients and potentially allow a few existing patients to avoid traveling to the current site, thus making their time slot available for someone else.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In order to achieve clinical outcomes, FQHCs will have to be creative and leverage new patient care models to successfully address the mood disorders and pharmacotherapy complexities faced by patients with diabetes. Our unique team-based approach has had a positive impact on patient satisfaction, according to anecdotal reports, and appears to improve glycemic control.</p>
<p>
<p>The team approach among patients with diabetes and pre-diabetes not only supplements one-to-one diabetes education but also places equal value on each discipline.</p>
</p>
<p>We believe our supplement to the care provided by primary care physicians and endocrinologists is a creative way to further improve patient&rsquo;s diabetes self-management as well as their overall physical and mental health, especially among a population that is burdened by a &ldquo;myriad of health challenges and socioeconomic circumstances that foster poor health outcomes . . . [in the Bronx], the least healthy county in New York State.&rdquo;<a href="#">20</a> This sense of urgency gives us more reason to implement this unique team approach in other clinic sites on campus.&emsp;n</p>
