<p>How many times have you heard someone ask, &ldquo;What is forensic pathology?&rdquo; Then when you begin
      to explain, they instantly draw upon a preconceived notion derived from televisions and
      movies. Yes, as forensic pathologists and medicolegal death investigators, we do attend death
      scenes, work on homicide cases, testify in court, and are involved in other activities within
      the crime and legal arena. But, there is so much more to the knowledge base of a forensic
      pathologist and the practice of forensic pathology. We are physicians, have extensive
      training, have patients, and perform medical procedures. Our patients may be a high profile
      murder victim, an abused child, or the victim of a motor vehicle collision. However, the
      expertise of a forensic pathologist and medicolegal death investigator goes far beyond
      examining what many view as the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; or &ldquo;routine&rdquo; forensic case. Often, the most
      challenging patients we examine and autopsy are those who die from complications of a natural
      disease(s) or a natural disease that is a complication of trauma. Approaching these cases
      requires knowledge of all body systems, male and female, from the unborn fetus to the aged.
      Pathology draws upon all the basic sciences and branches of clinical medicine. Often called
      &ldquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Doctor,&rdquo; pathologists are an integral part of the patient care team; diagnosing,
      treating, and preventing disease. The forensic pathologist takes all of this knowledge and
      experience and uses it to investigate injury and death, natural and unnatural, to certify the
      cause and manner of death, and use findings to improve public health and safety. This issue of
        <i>Academic Forensic Pathology</i> focuses on one of these body systems, the
      hepatobiliary system including the pancreas. Hepatic necrosis, pancreatitis, and fatty liver
      as well as the hepatobiliary system in cases of sudden death and child abuse are
      discussed.</p>
<p>Gross and microscopic findings with clinicopathologic correlation and ancillary studies such
      as chemistry and toxicology are presented. The topics are pertinent, and the respective
      authors proficient.</p>
<p>As you read through this issue, don&rsquo;t overlook the other sections such as methods and
      procedures, case of the month, and images in forensic pathology. This journal is unique and
      one of a kind for our specialty. Cover to cover, it cannot be beat!</p>
